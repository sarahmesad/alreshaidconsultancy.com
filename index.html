                <p>His research focuses on the domain of leadership and organizational change. In order for organizations to sustain their short and long-term performance, they must continually adapt to internal and external environmental changes. For instance, as organizations continue to grow, they require a reassessment of their organizational design, structure, and human capital to better align themselves with their strategic goals and attain organizational optimization. Whether the organization requires leadership or organizational change, we break these activities into three core stages of succession or structural change (pre, intra, and post). </p>
                <p>Pre-succession/structural change: In this stage, the organization's current design, structure, and human capital are rigorously evaluated to identify current organizational challenges that may be present, and need to be addressed. Thus, succession planning or planning for an organizational restructuring may be necessary to realign the organization with its future strategic priorities. Then a clear communication plan would be devised to communicate these expected changes to the members of the organization as a whole to reduce resistance to the proposed changes and instead allow for the acceptance, and support for these necessary changes. For instance, a past project consisted of planning for and then executing a Chairman, and CEO role split in a large local family business, while restructuring certain business units to be better aligned with this incurred change. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>Intra-succession/structural change: In this stage, the succession or structural change is unfolding and best practices from the field of change management, and leadership development are utilized to ensure that systematic change takes place. Aspects of leadership development become increasingly important when internal promotions from heads of department to CEO occurs. In a past project, a former head of the department was promoted to CEO and was instructed by the Chairman, and the board to receive leadership development training focused on the development of interpersonal work relationships throughout the CEO succession process. This training was requested by the Chairman and the board because they believed that the performance of the CEO would hinge on the successful development of interpersonal work relationships with other senior members of the organizations.       </p>
                <p>Post-succession/structural change: In this final stage, change is now complete and the change solution is continually monitored and evaluated. Thus, minor additional changes may be prescribed at this stage to ensure a successful closing of the project.</p>
                <p>Since the business environment is constantly changing and organizations are constantly growing, organizations will often need to undergo this change process to remain competitive and attain sustainable performance. </p>
